The attached CSV contains a list of ~650 schools and their latitude+longitude. 

Your task is to build a web application that allows users to search for schools within X miles of their location, or any other lat+longitude. Your application should render the results sorted by distances from the user's current location, with an indication of how many miles away they are from the school.

Feel free to use any off-the-shelf components you like. We'd like you to solve this problem like you would during an ordinary work day. Its most important that your solution works, but we appreciate a nice UI/UX as well.
